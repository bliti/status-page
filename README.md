status-page
======


### What is it?

A simple static status page to let you know if your API is currently online (or offline).


### Features:

The favicon changes from red to green and viceversa. It allows for the status to be conveyed quickly.

Bootstrap 3. It works properly on every screen.

Its simple. Super simple. Just uses Jquery.


### Stuff needed to use:

An API endpoint that returns a JSON response.
I used the following:

    {
		"ping": "pong",
		"when": timestamp
	}

I pass the "when" key to Javascript and use that to let the visitor know when the ping was received.

You can use whatever you like. Right now its setup to use a timestamp generated by JS code.

### Its ugly!

Yes! Its quite ugly. The basic layout is there. Just add whatever you need, change some colors and be happy.
